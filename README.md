## Transport
### 1. Introduction
1. If you’re wondering what is the best way to move from point A to point B in a completely unfamiliar city, the thought of public transport with all it’s fees and different kinds of tickets may seem a bit overwhelming. 

2. Strefa I includes the whole city of Krakow, whereas Strefa II is the area outside of the city boundaries (numbers of the buses that go there start with 2, 3 and 9 – when you’re travelling in one of these buses and have ticket only for Strefa I, you have to make sure to get out of the bus before it will cross the border of Strefa II). 

3. If you’re using the time-limited ticket, you have to be aware that once the time passes – the ticket becomes invalid. Bear that in mind once you get stuck in traffic! If that happens, you have to purchase and validate a new ticket.
